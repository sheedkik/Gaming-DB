# Gaming-Database

I wanted to create a one stop shop for all things videogames. Currently the website is capable of allowing users to add games if they are not already on the list, and add reviews to any game as well. There are of course more features going to be added such as customizable user profile page that will be implemented in the future, but for now, this website is all about adding your favorite game to the list and being able to see what others would agree are some of the best games out there!

Heres a quick Preview of my Videogames website!

###  Next steps:

 There are lots of ideas I have for the future of this website, here are just a few of my main ones!

 - The first thing I'll be adding to my website will be a user profile page. This will lay the groundwork for many of my smaller ideas that I have for the website.
 - Allowing users to customize their profile page. This of the old myspace days where you could make your profile as cool as you wanted, but this will be better!
 - Add options for users to add/favorite certain video games and store it in the users profile page. You will be able to add them to certain parts of your profile page such as your own personal top 10 gamelist, your game recommendations for others, and games for you to try!
 - There will be options to sort the homepage stackrank a few different ways. Currently it is automatically sorted by highest rating in descending order. I want to add options to allow users to sort alphabetically, release date, or # of reviews! This way you will be able to find what you are looking for, whether you want to check out what some of the newest games are, or if you want to try a new game and want to make sure its got tons of reviews to make sure you arent wasting your time with a game you may not enjoy.
